volatile 挥发性的, 不稳定,多变,动荡
	 C语言书籍这样定义volatile关键字：
	volatile提醒编译器它后面所定义的变量随时都有可能改变，因此编译后的程序每次需要存储或读取这个变量的时候，告诉编译器对该变量不做优化，都会直接从变量内存地址中读取数据，从而可以提供对特殊地址的稳定访问。
	如果没有volatile关键字，则编译器可能优化读取和存储，可能暂时使用寄存器中的值，如果这个变量由别的程序更新了的话，将出现不一致的现象。（简洁的说就是：volatile关键词影响编译器编译的结果，用volatile声明的变量表示该变量随时可能发生变化，与该变量有关的运算，不要进行编译优化，以免出错）
